      <h1> Health</h1>
      <p> Health is super important for your dog to live a good life. To get your dog healthy always make sure your
        dog gets the proper excercise and food. Your dog relies on you for that. It is also important to keep an eye
        on his drinking, sleeping, skin and coat. Always ask your veterinarian for advice on proper healthcare, so you
        and your dog can life your best life together! </p>

    <div id="Veterinarian" class="topic-content">
      <h1> Veterinarian</h1>
      <p> It is important to always seek medical advice from your vet if your dog is hurt or sick. There are different
        options for insurance to cover high costs. Your dog will show you if it is sick sometimes, but a dog can not
        talk ofcourse. You can always get a checkup at your local vet. Some vets even offer free programs to get your
        dog familiar with the vet and learn not to be scared. </p>

    <div id="Adopting" class="topic-content">
      <h1>Adopting!</h1>
      <p> Adopting a dog is always better than shopping a dog. There some important things to keep in mind when you
        get a dog. Always get a dog that fits your lifestyle. A labrador is for example a great family dog but not for
        running a marathon with you. Also, some dogs a have had a traumatic past. Sometimes you have to give them
        extra patience and love. But with the right education i am sure you will have a wonderfull life together. </p>
